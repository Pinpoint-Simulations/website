At the time, we also announced our first project, which is the PPS777-300ER or PPS777 for short. The project was the kickstart of our development for Microsoft Flight Simulator and introduced experienced developers to a different environment of development. Additionally, we have our Pinpoint Asphalt scenery projects. And to put the cherry on top, this is all going to be free. <p className="discontinued">The project was shutdown end of 2021</p></p>
